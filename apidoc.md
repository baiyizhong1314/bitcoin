Master Core API Documentation
=============================

##Introduction
Master Core is a fork of Bitcoin Core, with Master Protocol feature support added as a new layer of functionality on top.  As such interacting with the API is done in the same manner (JSON-RPC) as Bitcoin Core, simply with additional RPC calls available for utlizing Master Protocol features.

As all existing Bitcoin Core functionality is inherent to Master Core, the RPC port by default remains as 8332 as per Bitcoin Core.  If you wish to run Master Core in tandem with Bitcoin Core (eg via a seperate datadir) you may utilize the -rpcport<port> option to nominate an alternative port number.

###Simple Send
Simple send allows a Master Protocol currency to be transferred in a one-to-one transaction.  A 'sender' address, a 'recipient' address, a currency identifier and an amount must all be supplied.

*Please note, the private key for the requested 'sender' address must be available in the wallet.
